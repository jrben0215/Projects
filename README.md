These pictures are samples from 2 different projects.

First Project:
SQL file shows multiple queries getting churn rates by different metrics. Including tenure, payment method, contract length, and more.
Excel file shows a simple and straightforward dashboard containing important KPI's for the business and graphs showing the above metrics in table form to get a clearer view of what is going on.

Second Project:
Used Python initially to see the data in a couple of different ways, grouping the KPI's by different metrics, age group, gender, etc.
I then loaded the dataset in Power BI's interface where I made a straightforward dashboard showcasing these KPIs along with interactive visuals.

Below is a screenshot of the Excel dashboard:
